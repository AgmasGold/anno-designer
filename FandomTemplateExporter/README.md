# FandomTemplateExporter

This tool is used to generate a WikiText Template from a Anno Designer layout.

## Remarks

Currently only the [Prodcution layout](https://anno1800.fandom.com/wiki/Template:Production_layout) of the [wiki for Anno 1800](https://anno1800.fandom.com/) is supported. Feel free to extend the functionality :smile:

**The generated template is just meant as a starting point.** Please check for plausibility and adjust it to your needs.

## How it works

The tool loads a layout and generates a template with the information found in the presets files `wikiBuildingInfo.json` and `presets.json`.

## How to use

After compiling the code start the `FandomTemplateExporter.exe` WPF application.

If not already present, please select the presets files and your layout.

Press the `Generate Layout` button.

The generated template can be copied to where ever you like.
